### I worked on a lot of datasets here to perform different tasks such as web scraping, and pandas profiling, among others.

##### 1️⃣ For the web scraping, I created a Python script to extract data from Wikipedia pages, and consolidated it into one function that accepts a Wikipedia URL. 
##### 2️⃣ With Pandas profiling, I manipulated a Pandas Dataframe, by creating and querying a dataset using iloc for index-based selections and loc for label-based filtering.
